## Overview
Schedule builder application will allow you to:
#### Get department tables based on previous semesters
Using a Minnesota State University, Mankato website, an application will go over the selected department to execute the data about courses and create a formatted excel file. This formatted excel file is easy to read and also used to create both master and payroll table.
#### Create a Master Table
Will design your excel file into a room schedule table. It searches for different types of conflicts and will notify a user about them by using a friendly user interface and excel comments(to specify a location of conflict for the easier find).
#### Create a Payroll Table
An application will create an excel file based on department and their courses to provide information about the total amount of classes tough by a specific professor, cost center, and other essential information for a user. 
## Goals
Use Python programming language  to develop an academic course scheduling program that will  reduce internal course scheduling process time by up to 50%. Developed for College of Business at Minnesota State University, Mankato.
## Instructions
While you are using this program, you can select one or multiple files from "test_excel_files" folder to see a result.
